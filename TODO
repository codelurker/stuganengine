FIRST:

[ ] Switches, like Game.setConstant("foo",True) and Game.getConstant("bar",defaultValue). Need to come up with a good way to act upon states of switches too. (Like, if "foo" is True, print "bar" instead of "baz".)
[X] Really removing items from inventory when they have been used
[X] Come up with a way to make objects have multiple states and different replies. The sink for instance (with or without toothpaste)
[X] Break up actions into different Classes, but still inherit Action. How does that work in .py?`
[ ] Fix up the People and Topic classes. A lot. Need to be able to control visibility of topics
[ ] Implement a "Give" action. Neat huh? 

THEN:

[ ] Write a nice demo story with at least 4 items, 2 switches and one person
[ ] Release 0.1
